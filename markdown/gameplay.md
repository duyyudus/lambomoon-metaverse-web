### Chapter 1

In the beginning, players need to learn how to build Lambase stations ( and other types of NFT ). NFT items need to be combined properly ( by researching wiki ), otherwise they will be lost in vain.

Lambase is prerequisite for spaceship NFT engineering.

_NFT resource items and Lambase construction will be on-chain, players can interact with smart contracts through web frontend._

### Chapter 2

Players must have spaceship ready before flying to Lamda ( buy on market or build from scratch ). **In game, spaceship represents the number of rounds player can play per day.**

Here are several ways to get access to spaceship

- Buy on market
- If you already have Lambase, you can build spaceship yourself in NFT engineering
- Borrow from other players/guilds ( scholarship )

PvE monster combat gameplay will be in form of turn-based strategy and run in Unreal.

Player choose uncharted land plots ( no owner yet ), and fight with monsters living on it. By winning monster and clearing a land plot for the first time, player earn a small reward in LBM, and also take ownership of that land plot. After that, the owners can mine resource on their land plot by staking **[Mining machine](https://wiki.lamdamoon.xyz/Equipment-5c71927085e244239abd2b0240b11faa)** NFT item, this is where majority of LBM can be earned from the game. Details in [PvE System](https://wiki.lamdamoon.xyz/PvE-System-4d0ab0888fd94d649afdead5b80b78cb).

If a player clear monster in a land plot already owned by other player, there is no reward, however it still help in accumulating in-game experience point, which is neccessary for battle in more advanced land plots.

Although there is a lot of land on Lamda and it will take a lot of time for players to explore and take over them all, it is still limited. This design incentivizes early players to join the game to explore and secure land plots as soon as possible ( user acquisition )

When all land plots already explored and owned by existing players, the only way for new comer to earn LBM is

- Buy Lamda land from other players and mine LBM
- Winning in PvP, explained in Chapter 3

_NFT spaceship and weapon building process will be on-chain, players can interact with smart contracts through web frontend._
