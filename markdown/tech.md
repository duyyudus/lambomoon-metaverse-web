### Aptos & Polkadot

We originally aimed to build and deploy on Polkadot as a parachain which host important game data. But, a parachain is a bit overkill, complicated and expensive for early stage of the game, so we decided to go for another platform that is developer friendly, scalable, with a good degree of decentralization. Among L1 solutions on the market, Aptos seems to fit well with our needs ( we love Rust as well )

If things go well, in the future, we may extend to a Dot parachain and maintain cross chain bridge between two ecosystems.

### Unreal Engine 5

A metaverse cannot come true and will be only an empty promise if it does not allow user to interact and immerse in high fidelity 3D world.

Unreal Engine 5 is the most advanced game engine in the world, and with more than 10 years of experience in AAA game development, we know how to fully take advance of it to bring **Lamdamoon Metaverse vision** to life.

An in-game trailer will be released in Q1/2022 to realize our promise, stay tune !
