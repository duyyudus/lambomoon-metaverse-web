### Moonbeam Network

To keep it simple, we choose Moonbeam because we believe it will be the perfect Layer 1 blockchain platform, which is

- Most compatible with EVM, existing Ethereum toolchain should just work without any modification
- It is secured by Polkadot network, therefore even more decentralized than all Dapps platform in top 10 ( except Ethereum )
- It is the gateway to Substrate-based projects as well as Polkadot ecosystem
- And finally, Moonbeam has canary chain Moonriver, we have the luxury to test in production without the risk of losing huge amount of fund in case something go wrong. It will encourage us to take risk and foster innovation
- Oh, one last thing, its name has "moon" :D

In short/medium term, we are confident that Moonbeam is sufficient for the game. That said, if we are lucky, Lamdamoon Metaverse achieve crazy high growth and need to be on its own chain, we will build a new one using Substrate and run it as a parachain. It will be EVM compatible as well, hence migration from Moonbeam should be painless.

### Unreal Engine 5

A metaverse cannot come true and will be only an empty promise if it does not allow user to interact and immerse in high fidelity 3D world.

Unreal Engine 5 is the most advanced game engine in the world, and with more than 10 years of experience in AAA game development, we know how to fully take advance of it to bring **Lamdamoon Metaverse vision** to life.

An in-game trailer will be released in Q1/2022 to realize our promise, stay tune !
