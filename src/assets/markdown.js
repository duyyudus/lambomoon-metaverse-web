export const theGame = `**Lambomoon Metaverse** is an experimental high-end 3D NFT game built on top of Moonbeam/Polkadot and Unreal Engine 5.

**Lambomoon** is the moon of **Lambo**, the 3rd planet in **L.A.M.B.O solar system**. This is where you can build moonbase, spaceship, your army, even tele-portal powered by dark matter. All such things are stepping stones for you to explore, secure the land, collect resource, find ancient alien technology blueprint, and fight with monster to earn **Lambonium** reward on outlandish planets in a far-far away galaxy from earth.

And if getting bored, you can start a war with other players to take over their asset if you win ( you may lose though ). You can even fly spaceship in Lambo sky and fight with others.

Such activities, will happen in an immersive realistic 3D experience, powered by the most advanced game engine in the world.

And the greatest thing is, you own everything you try hard to achieve. It is permanently stored on blockchain, no one is able to take it from you.

You got hyped already ? Great, now let's fuel your spaceship and fly to the moon.

export const story = `
The year is 2042, a mysterious physical entity appear out of nowhere in the middle of pacific, whose appearance resemble a tele-portal. It quickly catch attention of all superpowers, and a multinational alliance is formed for the mission of research and exploration, to find out what or who is on other side of the portal.

They call it **The Genesis Portal.**

In the first mission, a small group of volunteers enter the portal, and return successfully. It turns out, the portal bring them to a moon-like asteroid which fly around a planet that seems to harbor life. The alliance decides to name that planet **Lonely Asteroid May Be Outlandish ( L.A.M.B.O )** and moon-like asteroid is **LAMBO Moon.**

Short names are **Lambo** and **Lambomoon.** And that alliance is **L.A.M.B.O Alliance.**

Given success and insights of the first mission, humanity decides to build many moonbases on Lambomoon which is the forwarding station for exploratory missions on Lambo planet. They are called **Lambases**, where our journey begins.

This is a fictional solar system in galaxy ***GN-z11***, the farthest galaxy from earth. It resembles our solar system and is the home of these planets

- **Suno** - this is the sun, the central planet of Lambo solar system
- **Veno** - closest planet to Suno, very hot and no life
- **Lambo** - a planet with life, like Earth. There used to be an advanced civilization here, however, it was destroyed by some unknown cause. Now, there are only creatures, monsters, and artifact of the long gone civilization
- **Lambomoon** - the moon of Lambo, where a mysterious portal was opened to Earth and allow human to teleport to Lambo solar system and Lambo planet
- **Maro** - unexplored planet
- **Jupito** - unexplored planet, farthest from Suno

### Chapter 1

In the beginning, players need to learn how to build Lambase stations ( and other types of NFT ). NFT items need to be combined properly ( by researching wiki ), otherwise they will be lost in vain.

Lambase is prerequisite for spaceship NFT engineering.

*NFT resource items and Lambase construction will be on-chain, players can interact with smart contracts through web frontend.*

### Chapter 2

Players must have spaceship ready before flying to Lambo ( buy on market or build from scratch ). **In game, spaceship represents the number of rounds player can play per day.**

Here are several ways to get access to spaceship

- Buy on market
- If you already have Lambase, you can build spaceship yourself in NFT engineering
- Borrow from other players/guilds ( scholarship )

PvE monster combat gameplay will be in form of turn-based strategy and run in Unreal.

Player choose uncharted land plots ( no owner yet ), and fight with monsters living on it. By winning monster and clearing a land plot for the first time, player earn a small reward in LBM, and also take ownership of that land plot. After that, the owners can mine resource on their land plot by staking **[Mining machine](https://wiki.lambomoon.xyz/Equipment-5c71927085e244239abd2b0240b11faa)** NFT item, this is where majority of LBM can be earned from the game. Details in [PvE System](https://wiki.lambomoon.xyz/PvE-System-4d0ab0888fd94d649afdead5b80b78cb).

If a player clear monster in a land plot already owned by other player, there is no reward, however it still help in accumulating in-game experience point, which is neccessary for battle in more advanced land plots.

Although there is a lot of land on Lambo and it will take a lot of time for players to explore and take over them all, it is still limited. This design incentivizes early players to join the game to explore and secure land plots as soon as possible ( user acquisition )

When all land plots already explored and owned by existing players, the only way for new comer to earn LBM is

- Buy Lambo land from other players and mine LBM
- Winning in PvP, explained in Chapter 3

*NFT spaceship and weapon building process will be on-chain, players can interact with smart contracts through web frontend.*

export const token = `
For detail of NFT, please see [NFT Items](https://wiki.lambomoon.xyz/NFT-Items-79eb28a204d84f808d4e5fc290eb57dc)

This section is about 2 main fungible tokens : **LBM** and **LDM**

## Lambonium - LBM

A new metal found on Lambo, which can be mined and has a lot of superior properties compare to titanium and vital for advanced equipment/weapon building. It is consumable and also main currency in the game.

You should read [PvE gameplay](https://wiki.lambomoon.xyz/Story-Gameplay-Reward-2264ecc193e04659adc9f3475e52ddf1) first to know more about reward mechanism.

**Default max supply : 200M**, this is the hard limit of LBM be mined on Lambo planet

**Full supply : 100M**

**Initial circulating supply : 21M**, from

- IDO - 8M
- Community Building - 8M
- Treasury - 5M

Circulating supply will heavily depend on amount of LBM earned in the game and consumed in NFT Engineering or burnt in Lambonium Reactor for Lambo Dark Matter.

Reward in early stage will be taken from 10% of 100M tokens, then will be minted until reaching **Max supply**.

By design, maximum inflation rate should be between 15% - 20% annually, it should take 5 to 7 years to reach default max supply limit. As a result, LBM reward rate is controlled by governance and limited to not exceed inflation ceiling. The ultimate purpose is to maintain a balance between benefit of gamers and economy health of the game.

We all know that both hyper-inflation and hyper-deflation are not good for any economy, therefore max supply limit may be adjusted by governance in a distance future ( when the game jump to Chapter 4, which will explore other planets )

**How to earn**

- Buy on market
- Rewarded in PvE by clearing a land plot on Lambo planet for the first time
- Stake **Mining machine** NFT items on Lambo land plots, majority of LBM will be earned in this way
- Winning and take from other players in PvP
- Rewarded in community events

**Utilities**

- Currency for NFT exchange
- Essential for infrastructure, equipment, and weapon NFT minting
- Burnt to produce **Lambo Dark Matter**
- Consumed in NFT Engineering process

## Lambo Dark Matter - LDM

A rare and mysterious substance discovered in alien artifacts on Lambo, which can be produced only by using [Lambonium Reactor](https://wiki.lambomoon.xyz/Equipment-5c71927085e244239abd2b0240b11faa)**.**

It allows human to build new tele-portals between Earth and any planet in Lambo Solar System. Anyone possess most LDM will be able to control Lambo Solar System, hence it is governance token.

**Supply** : not available until the game running for a while.

LDM is governance token, unlike other projects, the only way to mint new LDM is by burning LBM. This mechanism helps to mitigate the issue of "buying token for voting, then sell them", it represpents commitment of parties in Lambomoon governance.

*Just note that, in early stage, for smooth and fast development, governance is dev team itself, until coin-voting governance is enabled.*

**How to earn**

- Buy on market
- Burn a large amount of LBM in **Lambonium Reactor**

**Utilities**

- Governance, *e.g. control treasury spending on public goods, vote on reward rate...*
- Essential for creating new tele-portals as well as special equipment/weapon NFTs.
- Consumed in NFT Engineering process

### Moonbeam Network

To keep it simple, we choose Moonbeam because we believe it will be the perfect Layer 1 blockchain platform, which is

- Most compatible with EVM, existing Ethereum toolchain should just work without any modification
- It is secured by Polkadot network, therefore even more decentralized than all Dapps platform in top 10 ( except Ethereum )
- It is the gateway to Substrate-based projects as well as Polkadot ecosystem
- And finally, Moonbeam has canary chain Moonriver, we have the luxury to test in production without the risk of losing huge amount of fund in case something go wrong. It will encourage us to take risk and foster innovation
- Oh, one last thing, its name has "moon" :D

In short/medium term, we are confident that Moonbeam is sufficient for the game. That said, if we are lucky, Lambomoon Metaverse achieve crazy high growth and need to be on its own chain, we will build a new one using Substrate and run it as a parachain. It will be EVM compatible as well, hence migration from Moonbeam should be painless.

### Unreal Engine 5

A metaverse cannot come true and will be only an empty promise if it does not allow user to interact and immerse in high fidelity 3D world.

Unreal Engine 5 is the most advanced game engine in the world, and with more than 10 years of experience in AAA game development, we know how to fully take advance of it to bring **Lambomoon Metaverse vision** to life.

An in-game trailer will be released in Q1/2022 to realize our promise, stay tune !
